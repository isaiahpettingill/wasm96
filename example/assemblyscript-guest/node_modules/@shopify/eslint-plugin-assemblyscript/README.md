# @shopify/eslint-plugin-assemblyscript

Custom Eslint plugin to lint and validate assemblyscript.

## Warnings

This plugin is built using eslint-typescript/parser, which is obviously **not an assembly script parser**. Ultimately a custom parser for assemblescript that outputs an AST understood by Eslint would be ideal, but is quite a big endeavour. For now, we can rely on the fact that the syntax is mostly compatible with typescript to validate it.

## Installation

You'll first need to install [ESLint](http://eslint.org):

```
$ npm i eslint --save-dev
```

Next, install `@shopify/eslint-plugin-assemblyscript`:

```
$ npm install @shopify/eslint-plugin-assemblyscript --save-dev
```

**Note:** If you installed ESLint globally (using the `-g` flag) then you must also install `@shopify/eslint-plugin-assemblyscript` globally.

## Usage

Add `@shopify/assemblyscript` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:

```json
{
    "plugins": [
        "@shopify/assemblyscript"
    ]
}
```
