# RetroArch config snippet for using the wasm96 libretro core with .wasm/.wat/.w96 content.
#
# Purpose:
# - Provide a minimal, copy-pasteable snippet you can include from `retroarch.cfg`
# - Document common file-extension associations for "Open Content" workflows
#
# Notes:
# - RetroArch primarily uses core `.info` files to decide which extensions appear in
#   the file picker for a given core. Make sure you also install:
#     `info/wasm96_libretro.info`
# - `.w96` is just a renamed `.wasm` (identical bytes).

# --- Include ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copy this file somewhere RetroArch can read it, then add an include line to your
# main `retroarch.cfg` (path adjusted to where you placed it):
#
#   #include "/absolute/path/to/wasm96.cfg"
#
# RetroArch does not expand `~` reliably in all builds; prefer absolute paths.

# --- Core association (documentation) -----------------------------------------
# RetroArch does not have a universal, portable "extension -> core" mapping that
# works across all versions/platforms via `retroarch.cfg` alone.
#
# Practical ways to associate:
# 1) Load the core first:
#      Main Menu -> Load Core -> Wasm96
#    then:
#      Main Menu -> Load Content -> pick your `.wasm`/`.wat`/`.w96`
#
# 2) Use playlists (recommended for a library):
#    - Create a playlist entry that points at your content
#    - Set the playlist's core association to Wasm96
#
# 3) Use command-line (useful for testing):
#      retroarch -L /path/to/wasm96_libretro.so /path/to/game.w96
#
# This file intentionally does not try to set any per-core options since wasm96
# currently exposes its behavior via the guest module rather than RetroArch core
# options.

# --- Optional: reduce log spam during debugging -------------------------------
# Uncomment if you want more details in logs while troubleshooting:
# log_verbosity = "true"
# libretro_log_level = "0"  # 0=debug, 1=info, 2=warn, 3=error (varies by build)
