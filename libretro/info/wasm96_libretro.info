# wasm96 libretro core info file for RetroArch.
#
# Install:
#   - Copy this file into RetroArch's `info/` directory (e.g. ~/.config/retroarch/info/)
#   - Ensure the core binary is installed (e.g. `wasm96_libretro.so` / `.dll` / `.dylib`)
#   - Restart RetroArch (or update core info files) so it refreshes extension filters.
#
# Notes:
# - RetroArch uses this file to populate the core list and the content file picker filters.
# - `.w96` is a renamed `.wasm` (identical bytes), convenient for distribution.
